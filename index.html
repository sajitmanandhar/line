          Over the time that I've known you, I have come to realize that you are an incredible person. You are kind, thoughtful, and intelligent, and you have a way of making everyone around you feel at ease. I am constantly amazed by your strength and resilience, and I admire the way you always seem to find the good in people and situations.
          
          More than anything, though, I am struck by the way I feel when I'm around you. Being with you makes me happy in a way that I can't quite explain, and I find myself thinking about you constantly. I've come to realize that what I feel for you is more than just friendship - it's something deeper and more meaningful.
          
          I know that this might come as a surprise, and I don't want to put you on the spot or make you feel uncomfortable. But I couldn't keep these feelings inside any longer, and I wanted you to know how I truly feel.
          
          Please know that I understand if you don't feel the same way, and I don't want to jeopardize our friendship in any way. But if you do feel the same way, I would be honored to have you as my partner in life. I believe that we could have something really special together, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.
          
          Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and for being such an important part of my life. I hope that we can continue to be friends, and that we can talk about this further in person if you're comfortable with it. Love you."></textarea><br>
